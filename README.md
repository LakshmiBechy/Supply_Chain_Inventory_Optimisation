# Optimizing Instant Noodles Inventory in the Supply Chain with Machine Learning: A Regression Analysis

## Problem Description
   A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and supply. Where the demand is 
   high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to optimize the supply quantity in each and every 
   warehouse in the entire country.
   The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.
